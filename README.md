# WaterMarblingRobot

WaterMarblingRobot is a robotics project designed to automate the art of water marbling. The system consists of multiple modules, each responsible for different aspects of the marbling process.

## Repository Structure

- `BottomDraw/` - Controls the bottom drawing mechanism (PlatformIO project)
- `TopModule/` - Controls the top module (PlatformIO project)

Each module contains:
- `platformio.ini` - PlatformIO configuration
- `src/` - Source code
- `include/` - Header files
- `lib/` - Libraries
- `test/` - Test code

## Getting Started

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
2. Open the desired module folder in VS Code.
3. Use PlatformIO to build and upload the firmware to your microcontroller.
